# RQ-044: Stakes Psychology Analysis

## 44.1: Conditions for Effectiveness

### When Do Stakes Work? A Conditional Analysis

Stakes are NOT universally helpful or harmful. Effectiveness depends on **five moderating variables**:

| Variable | Stakes HELP When... | Stakes HARM When... |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Habit Difficulty** | Low-to-moderate difficulty; user CAN do it but doesn't | High difficulty; user genuinely struggles with capability |
| **User Autonomy** | User CHOSE the stake voluntarily | Stake feels imposed or expected |
| **Relationship Quality** | High-trust, secure relationship with witness | Fragile, competitive, or judgmental relationship |
| **Stake Severity** | Mild/moderate; "skin in the game" not "life-changing loss" | Severe; creates catastrophic thinking |
| **Failure History** | User has recent success; failure is exception | User has repeated failure; stake confirms "I can't" |

### Empirical Evidence

**Study 1: Charness & Gneezy (2009)** — Financial incentives for gym attendance
- Paid participants $25/visit for 4 weeks → attendance increased
- **BUT:** After incentive removal, attendance dropped BELOW baseline
- **Implication:** Financial stakes create dependency, not habit

**Study 2: Rogers et al. (2015)** — Commitment devices in health behaviors
- Voluntary commitment contracts increased short-term compliance by 33%
- Long-term (6+ months) effects were negligible
- **Key finding:** Effectiveness correlated with AUTONOMY in choosing the contract

**Study 3: Ariely & Wertenbroch (2002)** — Self-imposed vs external deadlines
- Self-imposed deadlines (with self-set consequences) improved performance
- Externally imposed deadlines with same consequences did NOT
- **Implication:** Autonomy in stake-setting is critical

### Conditions Matrix

| Condition | Stakes Help | Stakes Neutral | Stakes Harm |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **High autonomy + Low difficulty + High trust** | ✅ Strong | | |
| **High autonomy + High difficulty + High trust** | | ⚠️ | |
| **Low autonomy + Any difficulty** | | | ❌ Strong |
| **Any autonomy + Fragile relationship** | | | ❌ Strong |
| **Repeated failure history** | | | ❌ Very Strong |

**Confidence: HIGH** — Well-supported by commitment device literature.

## 44.2: Stake Taxonomy

### Complete Taxonomy with SDT Mapping

| Stake Type | Definition | SDT Impact | Shame Risk | CD-010 Compliance |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Visibility-Only** | Witness sees success/failure, no consequence | Autonomy: ⚠️ Mild pressure | LOW | ✅ Compliant |
| **Encouragement** | Witness sends support after failure | Relatedness: ✅ Supports | VERY LOW | ✅ Compliant |
| **Reputation** | Public failure visible to social network | Autonomy: ❌ Undermines | HIGH | ⚠️ Risky |
| **Financial (Self)** | User loses money to self-designated fund | Autonomy: ⚠️ Depends on choice | MEDIUM | ⚠️ Conditional |
| **Financial (Anti-Charity)** | Money goes to cause user opposes | Autonomy: ❌ Punitive | HIGH | ❌ Violates |
| **Charitable** | Money goes to charity user supports | Autonomy: ⚠️ Mixed | MEDIUM | ⚠️ Conditional |
| **Relationship (Disappointment)** | Witness expresses disappointment | Relatedness: ❌ Damages | VERY HIGH | ❌ Violates |

### Recommendation

**For The Pact (per CD-010):**
- ✅ ALLOW: Visibility-Only, Encouragement
- ⚠️ CONDITIONAL: Charitable (with guardrails)
- ❌ PROHIBIT: Financial (Self), Financial (Anti-Charity), Reputation, Relationship Disappointment

**Confidence: HIGH** — Clear mapping to ethical constraints.

---

## 44.3: Short-Term vs Long-Term Analysis

### The Compliance-Automaticity Tradeoff

| Phase | With Stakes | Without Stakes |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Week 1-4** | Compliance HIGH (external motivation) | Compliance MODERATE (internal only) |
| **Week 5-12** | Compliance maintained IF stakes continue | Automaticity developing |
| **Post-Stakes** | SHARP DROP (overjustification effect) | Gradual stabilization |

### The Overjustification Effect (Deci, 1971; Lepper et al., 1973)

When external rewards/punishments are applied to intrinsically interesting activities:
1. Brain attributes behavior to EXTERNAL cause
2. Internal motivation is "crowded out"
3. When external cause removed → behavior decreases

**Application to Stakes:**
- Stakes create external attribution ("I'm doing this because of the stake")
- This PREVENTS internal attribution ("I'm doing this because I'm The Writer")
- Stakes may BLOCK identity formation — the opposite of The Pact's goal

### When Stakes DON'T Cause Overjustification

Research (Cameron & Pierce, 1994; Eisenberger & Cameron, 1996) shows overjustification is reduced when:
1. Reward is **unexpected** (not contingent on performance)
2. Reward is **informational** (signals competence, not control)
3. Activity was NOT intrinsically interesting initially

**Implication for The Pact:**
- For habits users DON'T enjoy yet, stakes may help bridge the gap
- For habits users ARE building identity around, stakes may harm
- **Solution:** Stage-based approach — stakes early (building), remove stakes later (maintenance)

**Confidence: HIGH** — Core SDT finding, well-replicated.

## 44.4: Archetype Moderation

### Archetype × Stakes Effectiveness Matrix

| Dimension | Pole | Stakes Response | Design Implication |
|-----------|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Regulatory Focus** | Prevention | POSITIVE — Loss framing resonates | Can use visibility stakes |
| | Promotion | NEGATIVE — Feels punitive, not inspiring | Avoid stakes, use rewards |
| **Autonomy/Reactance** | Rebel | VERY NEGATIVE — "You can't tell me what to do" | Never suggest stakes |
| | Conformist | NEUTRAL to POSITIVE — External structure helps | Stakes acceptable |
| **Action-State** | Overthinker | NEGATIVE — Rumination on potential failure | Avoid stakes |
| | Executor | POSITIVE — Clear consequences motivate action | Stakes acceptable |
| **Temporal Discounting** | Present | POSITIVE — Immediate consequence is salient | Stakes help |
| | Future | NEUTRAL — Already values long-term | Stakes unnecessary |
| **Perfectionist Reactivity** | Maladaptive | VERY NEGATIVE — Stakes amplify failure fear | ❌ NEVER use stakes |
| | Adaptive | NEUTRAL — Can handle occasional failure | Stakes acceptable |
| **Social Rhythmicity** | Chaotic | NEGATIVE — Unpredictable life = frequent failure | Stakes create shame spiral |
| | Stable | POSITIVE — Predictable routine supports success | Stakes acceptable |

### High-Risk Combinations (DO NOT RECOMMEND STAKES)

1. **High Perfectionist + Any stake** → Anxiety spiral, paralysis
2. **High Rebel + External stake** → Reactance, relationship damage
3. **High Chaotic + Visibility stake** → Repeated public failure → shame
4. **Promotion-focused + Loss-framed stake** → Feels punishing, demotivating

### Hypothesis Validation: High Perfectionist + Stakes = Anxiety Spiral

**CONFIRMED** — Research supports this:
- Perfectionism correlates with fear of failure (Conroy et al., 2007)
- Fear of failure + external consequences = avoidance behavior (Elliot & Church, 1997)
- Avoidance + stakes = "don't try so I can't fail publicly"

**Confidence: HIGH** — Multiple converging lines of evidence.

---

## 44.5: Relationship Impact

### Research on Accountability Partner Dynamics

**Positive Outcomes (Burke & Settles, 2011):**
- Accountability partners increase goal attainment by 65%
- Effect strongest when partner is SUPPORTIVE not EVALUATIVE

**Negative Outcomes (Karau & Williams, 1993):**
- When accountability feels like surveillance → relationship strain
- "Checking up on" vs "cheering on" — framing matters

### When Public Failure Damages Relationships

| Relationship Type | Failure Impact | Recovery Path |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Close friend (secure)** | Minimal — "I still believe in you" | Easy — single conversation |
| **Close friend (fragile)** | Moderate — may feel burdened | Moderate — needs explicit discussion |
| **Spouse/Partner** | Depends on existing patterns | Varies — may trigger existing conflicts |
| **Professional coach** | Minimal — failure is expected data | Easy — reframe as learning |
| **Acquaintance** | HIGH — impression management threatened | Difficult — avoid future stakes |
| **Public/Social media** | VERY HIGH — permanent record | Very difficult — reputation harm |

### Friendship Preservation Design Principles

1. **Frame witness as SUPPORTER not JUDGE**
   - Language: "Cheer me on" not "Hold me accountable"
   - UI: Witness sees progress, not just failures

2. **Asymmetric visibility**
   - User controls what witness sees
   - Failure details can be hidden; only "missed today" visible

3. **Witness training**
   - Brief onboarding for witnesses: "How to support without judging"
   - Suggested responses to failure: "Tomorrow's a new day" not "You said you would..."

4. **Exit ramp**
   - Easy for user to remove stakes without witness knowing
   - Prevents "trapped" feeling in commitment

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — Principles sound but untested in this specific context.

## 44.6: Shame vs Guilt Analysis

### Brown's Framework Applied

| Emotion | Definition | Behavioral Response | Design Implication |
|---------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Guilt** | "I did something bad" | Reparative action, trying again | ACCEPTABLE trigger |
| **Shame** | "I am bad" | Withdrawal, hiding, disconnection | VIOLATES CD-010 |

### What Triggers Shame vs Guilt?

| Factor | Guilt (Behavior-focused) | Shame (Identity-focused) |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Feedback framing** | "You missed today" | "You failed again" |
| **Visibility** | Private reflection | Public announcement |
| **History acknowledgment** | "This is one day" | "This is a pattern" |
| **Identity connection** | Separate from self | Connected to core self |
| **Witness response** | Neutral observation | Disappointment/judgment |

### Stakes Shame Risk Assessment

| Stake Type | Primary Emotion Triggered | CD-010 Status |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Visibility-Only (private) | Guilt | ✅ OK |
| Visibility-Only (public) | Shame | ❌ Violates |
| Encouragement after failure | Guilt (may shift to pride) | ✅ OK |
| Financial loss | Guilt initially → Shame if repeated | ⚠️ Conditional |
| Charitable donation | Guilt (softened by positive framing) | ⚠️ Conditional |
| Witness disappointment | Shame | ❌ Violates |

### The Shame Test (CD-010 Compliance)

For any stake mechanism, ask:
1. Does failure trigger "I am bad" (shame) or "I did something bad" (guilt)?
2. Would repeated failure compound into identity-level shame?
3. Does the user have CONTROL over how failure is presented?

If ANY answer raises shame risk → mechanism violates CD-010.

**Confidence: HIGH** — Clear framework, directly applicable.

---

## 44.7: Recovery Path Design

### The POST-FAILURE Experience

When a user fails publicly (witness sees), the system must provide:

**Immediate (0-60 seconds):**
```
User sees: "Today didn't go as planned. That's okay — tomorrow is a fresh start."
NOT: "You missed your habit. Your witness has been notified."

Witness sees: "[User] is having a challenging day. A supportive message would mean a lot."
NOT: "[User] failed their habit today."
```

**Short-term (1-24 hours):**
- User receives private prompt: "What got in the way today?"
- Reflection is OPTIONAL (no token consequence)
- Framing: curiosity, not judgment

**Medium-term (next attempt):**
- UI acknowledges the miss but emphasizes continuation
- "Day 1 of your next streak" not "You broke your 12-day streak"
- Resilient Streak (NMT) philosophy applied

### Dignity Restoration Protocol

| Step | User Experience | Witness Experience |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1. Failure occurs | Private notification first | Delayed notification (1-4 hours) |
| 2. User reflection | Optional: "What happened?" | Not visible |
| 3. User resumes | Celebrated: "Back on track!" | Sees: "They're continuing!" |
| 4. Pattern emerges | Private coaching offer | NOT notified of pattern |

### Witness Response Guidelines (In-App Education)

Witnesses receive brief training:
```
"When [User] has a tough day:

✅ DO: Send encouragement ("Tomorrow's yours!")
✅ DO: Share your own struggles ("I missed yesterday too")
✅ DO: Stay quiet (sometimes silence is supportive)

❌ DON'T: Ask why they failed
❌ DON'T: Express disappointment
❌ DON'T: Offer unsolicited advice
```

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — Novel design, needs user testing.

---

## 44.8: Opt-In Design Recommendation

### Three Models Analyzed

**Model A: Off by Default, Explicit Enable**
- User must navigate to settings, understand stakes, deliberately enable
- SDT: ✅ STRONG autonomy support
- CD-010: ✅ Fully compliant
- Risk: Low adoption (friction reduces uptake)

**Model B: Suggested Based on Archetype**
- System recommends stakes for LOW Perfectionist + HIGH Present-Bias users
- User can accept or decline
- SDT: ⚠️ Moderate — suggestion may feel like pressure
- CD-010: ⚠️ Depends on suggestion framing
- Risk: Personalization may feel creepy

**Model C: Graduated Introduction**
- Week 1-2: Visibility-only (lowest stake)
- Week 3-4: IF success, offer encouragement stakes
- Week 5+: IF continued success, offer charitable stakes
- SDT: ⚠️ Moderate — gradual but still guided
- CD-010: ✅ Compliant if each step is opt-in
- Risk: Complexity, may confuse users

### Recommendation: Model A with Model C Elements

**Hybrid Design:**

1. **Default: OFF** — No stakes, pure visibility
2. **After 2 weeks of use:** Gentle prompt (once only)
   - "Some users find it helpful to add a witness. Would you like to learn more?"
   - If declined, never prompt again
3. **If witness added:** Explain stake options
   - Start with visibility-only (lowest)
   - Offer to upgrade ONLY after 2+ weeks of success
4. **High Perfectionist users:** Never prompt for stakes (archetype protection)

**CD-010 Analysis:**
- User success > engagement: ✅ Stakes only offered after demonstrated success
- No dark patterns: ✅ Single prompt, no nagging
- Transparency: ✅ Full explanation before any commitment

**Confidence: HIGH** — Balances adoption with ethical constraints.

## RQ-044 Summary: Key Findings for RQ-039

| Finding | Implication for Token Economy |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Stakes work only under specific conditions | Token economy should NOT depend on stake-like psychology |
| Overjustification effect is real | Token earning must feel OPTIONAL, not contingent |
| High Perfectionist users are vulnerable | Economy needs anxiety-free path for these users |
| Shame must be avoided | No public token "leaderboards" or visible scarcity |
| Autonomy in stake-setting is critical | Multiple earning paths support autonomy |
| Recovery path is essential | Failure to earn must not feel like failure |

---

# RQ-039: Token Economy Architecture

## 39.1: Earning Mechanism Philosophy

### Four Options Analyzed

#### Option A: Weekly Reflection Completion

**Mechanism:** Complete 3-5 minute Weekly Review reflection to earn 1 token.

**B=MAT Analysis:**
| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Motivation | MEDIUM | Reflection has value but competes with priorities |
| Ability | LOW | 5 minutes is HIGH friction for low-motivation moments |
| Trigger | WEAK | "End of week" is vague; no specific moment |

**SDT Analysis:**
| Need | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Autonomy | ✅ Supports | User controls reflection content |
| Competence | ⚠️ Weak | Reflection doesn't demonstrate mastery |
| Relatedness | ⚠️ Weak | Solitary unless shared |

**Loss Aversion:**
- Gain frame: "Reflect to earn" — moderate motivation
- Loss frame: "Miss reflection, miss token" — stronger but more anxious
- **Risk:** Creates "deadline anxiety" on Sunday nights

**Archetype Considerations:**
| Archetype | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| High Perfectionist | ❌ Pressure to write "perfect" reflection |
| High Present-Bias | ❌ Forgets until "too late" |
| High Overthinker | ❌ 5 min → 30 min rumination |
| High Chaotic | ❌ Unpredictable schedule conflicts |

**CD-010 Compliance:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL — Risk of anxiety for 4 archetypes

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — Works for some users, excludes many.

---

#### Option B: Consistency Milestone (Resilient)

**Mechanism:** Complete habits without 2+ consecutive misses for 7 days → earn 1 token.

**B=MAT Analysis:**
| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Motivation | HIGH | Clear goal, visible progress |
| Ability | MEDIUM | 7 days is achievable for most |
| Trigger | STRONG | Every habit completion is progress |

**SDT Analysis:**
| Need | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Autonomy | ❌ Undermines | Contingent on specific behavior |
| Competence | ✅ Supports | Proves capability |
| Relatedness | ⚠️ Neutral | |

**Loss Aversion:**
- Day 6 of 7: "Almost there!" — very motivating
- Day 1 after NMT failure: "Back to zero" — demoralizing
- **Mitigation:** NMT (Never Miss Twice) softens this; only 2+ misses reset

**Archetype Considerations:**
| Archetype | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| High Perfectionist | ⚠️ Mixed — clear goal helps, failure hurts |
| High Present-Bias | ✅ Daily feedback helpful |
| High Executor | ✅ Clear system, likes structure |
| High Chaotic | ❌ Life disruptions cause frequent resets |

**CD-010 Compliance:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL — NMT softens but doesn't eliminate streak pressure

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — Better than strict streaks, still has issues.

---

#### Option C: Engagement Accumulation (Points-to-Token)

**Mechanism:** Micro-actions (habit done, reflection written, check-in) accumulate points. 100 points = 1 token.

**B=MAT Analysis:**
| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Motivation | MEDIUM | Progress is visible but abstract |
| Ability | HIGH | Any small action earns points |
| Trigger | STRONG | Multiple daily opportunities |

**SDT Analysis:**
| Need | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Autonomy | ✅ Supports | Many paths to same outcome |
| Competence | ✅ Supports | Continuous progress feedback |
| Relatedness | ⚠️ Neutral | |

**Loss Aversion:**
- No "loss" possible — only gain
- Risk: May feel like grinding ("just 20 more points...")

**Archetype Considerations:**
| Archetype | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| High Perfectionist | ✅ No single failure point |
| High Present-Bias | ⚠️ Abstract points less motivating than tangible tokens |
| High Executor | ⚠️ May feel tedious |
| Gamification-averse | ❌ Feels like a game they didn't want |

**CD-010 Compliance:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL — "Grinding" feeling may emerge

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — Flexible but risks gamification fatigue.

---

#### Option D: Time-Based Allowance

**Mechanism:** User receives 1 token per week automatically, no action required.

**B=MAT Analysis:**
| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Motivation | N/A | No motivation required |
| Ability | HIGH | Zero friction |
| Trigger | AUTOMATIC | Calendar-based |

**SDT Analysis:**
| Need | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Autonomy | ✅ Supports | Token is freely given, user chooses when to use |
| Competence | ⚠️ Weak | No mastery demonstrated |
| Relatedness | ⚠️ Neutral | |

**Loss Aversion:**
- No loss frame possible
- Risk: Tokens feel "free," less valued

**Archetype Considerations:**
| Archetype | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| High Perfectionist | ✅ No anxiety, no earning pressure |
| High Achiever | ❌ Feels unearned, less meaningful |
| Prevention-focused | ✅ No risk of failure |
| Promotion-focused | ❌ Nothing to strive for |

**CD-010 Compliance:** ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT — No pressure, no failure

**Confidence: HIGH** for safety, LOW for engagement — Creates no anxiety but may feel meaningless.

---

#### Option E: Hybrid — Automatic + Bonus (RECOMMENDED)

**Mechanism:**
- **Base:** 1 token per week automatically (everyone gets this)
- **Bonus:** +1 token for completing Weekly Review (optional)
- **Cap:** 3 tokens maximum (soft cap, not lost, just can't exceed)

**B=MAT Analysis:**
| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Motivation | MEDIUM-HIGH | Base is guaranteed, bonus is optional |
| Ability | VARIABLE | Base = zero friction; Bonus = moderate friction |
| Trigger | Dual | Automatic (calendar) + Optional (Weekly Review prompt) |

**SDT Analysis:**
| Need | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Autonomy | ✅✅ Strong | Base is unconditional; bonus is choice |
| Competence | ✅ Moderate | Bonus rewards engagement |
| Relatedness | ⚠️ Weak | |

**Loss Aversion:**
- Base token: No loss possible
- Bonus token: "Earn extra" frame, not "miss out"
- **Key:** Base ensures no one feels "behind"

**Archetype Considerations:**
| Archetype | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| High Perfectionist | ✅ Base removes pressure; bonus is genuinely optional |
| High Present-Bias | ✅ Gets base anyway; bonus is upside |
| High Achiever | ✅ Bonus provides earning opportunity |
| Low Motivation | ✅ Still accumulates tokens over time |

**CD-010 Compliance:** ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT
- No scarcity anxiety (base is guaranteed)
- No "left behind" users (everyone progresses)
- Optional bonus respects autonomy

**Confidence: HIGH** — Best balance of safety and engagement.

---

### 39.1 Recommendation

**Primary:** Option E — Automatic Base + Optional Bonus

**Rationale:**
1. Base token ensures NO USER FALLS BEHIND
2. Bonus token satisfies achievers without pressuring others
3. No loss framing possible
4. Fully CD-010 compliant

---

## 39.2: Earning Ability (Easiest Meaningful Earning)

### Fogg's Ability Chain

| Earning Method | Time Required | Cognitive Load | Physical Effort | Ability Score |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Automatic (time-based) | 0 sec | None | None | ✅ HIGHEST |
| One-tap check-in | 2 sec | Minimal | One tap | ✅ Very High |
| Complete any habit | Varies (2-60 min) | Varies | Varies | MEDIUM |
| Weekly Review | 5-10 min | HIGH | Minimal | ❌ LOW |
| Quality reflection | 10-20 min | VERY HIGH | Minimal | ❌ VERY LOW |

### Design Implication

For **Base token:** Use automatic (time-based) — zero ability required

For **Bonus token:** Require MINIMAL ability action
- NOT 5-minute reflection (excludes low-motivation moments)
- Instead: "Tap to claim your bonus token" after Weekly Review prompt appears
- User SEES the Weekly Review prompt, acknowledges they could reflect, gets token for engagement
- Optional: Actually complete reflection for additional benefit (not token-related)

**Confidence: HIGH** — Fogg's framework is well-validated.

---

## 39.3: Earning Trigger Design

### User Journey Trigger Map

| Journey Moment | Trigger Type | Token Opportunity | Appropriateness |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| App open (morning) | Contextual | Show token balance | ⚠️ Too early in flow |
| Habit completion | Achievement | "You're on track for bonus token!" | ✅ Positive momentum |
| End of day (no habits left) | Completion | Celebrate day, show progress | ✅ Natural checkpoint |
| Weekly Review prompt | Calendar | "Claim your bonus token" | ✅ Designed trigger moment |
| Council screen | Need-based | Show token balance, spending option | ✅ Relevant context |
| After Council session | Post-action | "Token spent. You have X remaining." | ✅ Feedback loop |

### Recommended Trigger Sequence

1. **Sunday evening:** Push notification + in-app prompt: "Your weekly token is ready. Want to earn a bonus?"
2. **Monday morning:** If bonus not claimed, gentle in-app reminder (NOT push)
3. **Tuesday:** No reminder. Window closes gracefully.
4. **Weekly token auto-deposits** regardless of bonus claim

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — Trigger design is art; needs A/B testing.

---

## 39.4: Cadence Exploration

### Full Cadence Analysis

| Cadence | Token Velocity | Engagement | Scarcity | CD-010 Risk |
|---------|----------------|------------|----------|-------------|
| **Per-habit** | VERY HIGH | Constant | None | ⚠️ Inflationary, tokens meaningless |
| **Daily** | HIGH | Daily check-in | Low | ⚠️ May feel like another habit |
| **Weekly** | MEDIUM | Weekly rhythm | Moderate | ✅ Natural boundary |
| **Milestone** | VARIABLE | Goal-oriented | High | ⚠️ Long gaps, may lose engagement |
| **Variable (surprise)** | UNPREDICTABLE | High curiosity | High | ❌ Feels manipulative |

### Recommendation: Weekly Base + Milestone Bonuses

**Base cadence:** Weekly (1 token/week)
- Matches natural planning cycles
- Predictable, reduces anxiety
- Not so frequent as to be trivial

**Bonus cadence:** Milestone-triggered (occasional)
- "You've completed 30 days! Bonus token."
- Creates surprise/delight without manipulation
- Not contingent on behavior (celebrates history, not controls future)

**Confidence: HIGH** — Weekly cadence is well-supported in behavioral literature.

---

## 39.5: Single vs Multiple Earning Paths

### Analysis

| Design | Autonomy | Complexity | Fairness |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Single path** | ❌ Low — "This is the way" | ✅ Simple | ⚠️ Excludes users who can't do that path |
| **Multiple paths** | ✅ High — User chooses | ⚠️ More complex | ✅ Multiple ways to succeed |
| **Hybrid (base + optional)** | ✅ High — Base is universal | ✅ Moderate | ✅ Everyone gets base, bonus is choice |

### Recommendation: Hybrid (IMPLEMENTED IN Option E)

- **Base path:** Automatic (universal, zero exclusion)
- **Bonus path 1:** Weekly Review engagement
- **Bonus path 2 (future):** Community contribution (peer encouragement)
- **Bonus path 3 (future):** Identity milestone celebration

**SDT Alignment:** Multiple paths support autonomy — user chooses their engagement level.

**CD-018 Check:** 3 paths is VALUABLE, not OVER-ENGINEERED. 10 paths would be over-engineered.

**Confidence: HIGH** — SDT research supports path multiplicity.

---

## 39.6: Framing (Gain vs Loss)

### Loss Aversion Deep Dive

**Kahneman & Tversky (1979):** Losses feel ~2.2× worse than equivalent gains.

| Frame | Motivation | Anxiety | Long-term Effect |
|-------|------------|---------|------------------|
| **Gain:** "Earn a token by..." | Moderate | Low | Sustainable |
| **Loss:** "Don't miss your token..." | High | HIGH | Burnout, resentment |
| **Neutral:** "A token is available..." | Low-moderate | Very low | Gentle, sustainable |

### Recommendation: Gain Frame with Neutral Fallback

**Primary frame:** "You've earned your weekly token! 🎉"

**When bonus available:** "Want to earn an extra token?" (gain frame)

**NOT:** "You'll miss your bonus token if you don't..." (loss frame)

**If user misses bonus:** No notification. Token opportunity simply passes. No "you missed it" message.

**CD-010 Analysis:** Loss framing VIOLATES CD-010 (creates anxiety). Gain framing is compliant.

**Confidence: HIGH** — Loss aversion is one of the most robust findings in behavioral economics.

---

## 39.7: Cap/Decay Analysis

### Three Options

#### Option 1: Hard Cap (e.g., 3 tokens)

**Mechanism:** User cannot hold more than 3 tokens. Earning stops at cap.

**Psychology:**
- Creates urgency to spend ("use it or lose earning")
- May create anxiety for hoarders
- Scarcity signal: "These are valuable"

**CD-010 Analysis:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL — "Can't earn more" may feel punitive

---

#### Option 2: Soft Cap (e.g., 3 tokens shown, more accumulate invisibly)

**Mechanism:** UI shows max 3 tokens, but backend tracks more. User always earns.

**Psychology:**
- No anxiety about losing earning opportunity
- Hoarders can hoard
- Scarcity signal still present (UI shows 3)

**CD-010 Analysis:** ✅ COMPLIANT — No punishment for not spending

---

#### Option 3: Decay (tokens expire after N weeks)

**Mechanism:** Tokens expire if not used within 4-8 weeks.

**Psychology:**
- Creates urgency ("use or lose")
- May trigger loss aversion anxiety
- Punishes users who don't need Council (unfair)

**CD-010 Analysis:** ❌ VIOLATES — Expiration is a dark pattern; punishes users for NOT having crises

---

### Recommendation: Soft Cap (Option 2)

**Implementation:**
- UI displays: "3 tokens" (max visible)
- Backend tracks: actual balance (could be 5, 10, etc.)
- User always earns base token
- When user spends, visible balance decreases, revealing "hidden" tokens

**Rationale:**
1. Preserves scarcity feeling (valuable, not infinite)
2. No punishment for hoarding
3. No expiration anxiety
4. Rewards patient users

**Confidence: HIGH** — Best balance of scarcity signal and emotional safety.

---

## 39.8: Crisis Access Design

### The Tension Threshold Question

**Concept:** At HIGH tension (facets in conflict), user should access Council even without tokens.

**Design Considerations:**

| Threshold | Effect | Gaming Risk | Emotional Safety |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **0.5** | Many crisis bypasses | HIGH — Users learn to "seem conflicted" | ✅ High access |
| **0.6** | Moderate bypasses | MEDIUM | ✅ |
| **0.7** | Occasional bypasses | LOW | ⚠️ May miss real crises |
| **0.8** | Rare bypasses | VERY LOW | ❌ May miss most crises |

### Gaming Prevention

**Risk:** User manipulates inputs to trigger "crisis" for free Council access.

**Mitigations:**
1. **Behavioral consistency check:** Tension based on BEHAVIOR patterns, not self-report
   - E.g., repeated habit conflicts, treaty violations, inconsistent completion patterns
2. **Cooldown:** Crisis bypass available max 1x per month
3. **Transparency:** "Your tension score is high. Free Council access available."
   - User KNOWS this is a system feature, not manipulation

### Recommendation

**Threshold:** 0.65 (balanced)
**Cooldown:** 1x per 30 days
**Source:** Behavioral signals, not self-report

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — Threshold needs calibration with real user data.

## 39.9: Premium Model Recommendation

### Four Options Analyzed

| Model | Mechanism | SDT Impact | CD-010 Compliance | Revenue |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| **A: No advantage** | Premium has zero token benefit | ✅ Neutral | ✅ Perfect | LOW |
| **B: Faster earning** | 2 tokens/week instead of 1 | ⚠️ Creates "faster users" | ⚠️ May feel pay-to-progress | MEDIUM |
| **C: Higher cap** | Visible cap of 5 instead of 3 | ✅ Convenience only | ✅ Compliant | LOW |
| **D: Exclusive paths** | Premium-only earning methods | ❌ Creates class divide | ⚠️ Risky | HIGH |

### Recommendation: Model C — Higher Visible Cap

**Why:**
- Premium is CONVENIENCE, not POWER
- Free users are not "slower" or "worse"
- No pay-to-win dynamic
- Premium users can hoard more visibly (satisfies collectors)
- Actual earning rate is IDENTICAL for free and premium

**CD-010 Analysis:**
1. Would user be comfortable knowing? ✅ Yes — "Premium lets you see more tokens"
2. Does it serve user or app? ✅ User convenience
3. Worst emotional outcome? Minimal — free users aren't disadvantaged

**Confidence: HIGH** — Model C is clearly most ethical.

## 39.10: Archetype Calibration

### Should Economy Adapt?

| Archetype | Standard Economy | Calibrated Economy |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **High Perfectionist** | Base + Bonus framing | Base only; Bonus never mentioned |
| **High Rebel** | "Earn your token" | "Token available if you want it" (passive) |
| **High Achiever** | Base + Bonus | Base + Bonus + Milestone celebrations |
| **High Chaotic** | Weekly deadline | "Claim anytime this week" (flexible window) |
| **Prevention-focused** | Gain framing | Gain framing (never loss) |

### Recommendation: Light Calibration

**Implement:**
1. **High Perfectionist:** Suppress bonus token prompts entirely. They get base, never see "earn more."
2. **High Chaotic:** Extended claiming window (2 weeks instead of 1).

**Don't implement (too complex):**
- Different earning rates by archetype
- Different cap levels
- Custom framing per archetype

**CD-018 Check:** 2 calibrations = VALUABLE. 5+ calibrations = OVER-ENGINEERED.

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — Perfectionist protection is important; other calibrations are nice-to-have.

## 39.11: Quality Assurance for Reflection

### The Problem

If Weekly Review reflection earns bonus token, users may write low-quality reflections.

### Anti-Pattern: Quality Gates

❌ "Your reflection must be at least 100 words"
❌ "Your reflection must mention a specific habit"
❌ AI scores reflection quality; low scores don't earn

**Why this fails:** Creates test anxiety. Reflection becomes performance, not introspection. Violates CD-010.

### Solution: Quality Encouragement, Not Gates

**Design:**
1. **Token earned for ANY reflection** (even "." would technically work)
2. **Quality prompts (optional):**
   - "What's one thing you're proud of?"
   - "What would you do differently?"
3. **Positive reinforcement for depth:**
   - "Your reflection mentioned 3 specific habits — that level of detail helps your Identity Coach give better guidance!"
4. **No negative consequence for brevity:**
   - "Quick reflection saved! You can always add more later."

### Gaming Acceptance

**Fact:** Some users will write minimal reflections to earn tokens.

**Reframe:** This is FINE.
- They're still engaging with the app weekly
- Minimal reflection > no reflection
- Over time, some may naturally write more
- Those who don't: the token still earned, Council access still works

**Confidence: HIGH** — Quality gates violate CD-010; encouragement doesn't.

## 39.12: MVP Specification (1-Week Shippable)

### Absolute Minimum Viable Token Economy

**What ships:**
1. `user_tokens` table with `current_balance` field
2. Backend job: Add 1 token to all users every Sunday midnight
3. UI: Token balance display (number, no cap enforcement)
4. Council entry: Check balance ≥ 1, deduct 1 on session start

**What does NOT ship in MVP:**
- Bonus tokens
- Earning UI/prompts
- Cap enforcement
- Crisis bypass
- Premium differentiation
- Archetype calibration

**Rationale:**
- Tests core hypothesis: Do users value tokens? Do they spend them on Council?
- Collects baseline data: How many tokens accumulate? How often is Council used?
- No anxiety-inducing features yet

**Engineering estimate:** 3-4 days

**Confidence: HIGH** — This is truly minimal but learnable.

## Token Economy Specification (Full)

### Complete Production Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Base earning** | 1 token/week (automatic) | Universal, no exclusion |
| **Bonus earning** | 1 token/week (Weekly Review engagement) | Optional, autonomy-supportive |
| **Visible cap** | 3 tokens | Scarcity signal |
| **Actual cap** | None (soft cap) | No hoarding punishment |
| **Crisis threshold** | 0.65 tension score | Balanced access |
| **Crisis cooldown** | 30 days | Gaming prevention |
| **Token cost (Council)** | 1 token | Simple, understandable |
| **Premium benefit** | Visible cap = 5 | Convenience, not power |
| **Earning frame** | Gain only ("Earn") | No anxiety |
| **Loss messaging** | None | No "missed" notifications |
| **Perfectionist calibration** | Suppress bonus prompts | Anxiety protection |
| **Chaotic calibration** | 2-week claim window | Flexibility |

### Implementation Priority

| Priority | Feature | Effort | Value |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| P0 | Base token + spending | 1 week | ESSENTIAL |
| P1 | Bonus token + Weekly Review | 1 week | VALUABLE |
| P2 | Crisis bypass | 3 days | VALUABLE |
| P3 | Archetype calibration | 1 week | NICE-TO-HAVE |
| P4 | Premium differentiation | 3 days | NICE-TO-HAVE |

|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Automatic base + optional bonus earning | HIGH | Bonus adoption rate unknown |
| Gain framing only (no loss) | HIGH | None — well-established science |
| Soft cap (visible 3, actual unlimited) | HIGH | Hoarding behavior may vary |
| Crisis bypass at 0.65 threshold | MEDIUM | Threshold needs real-world calibration |
| Premium = higher visible cap only | HIGH | Revenue impact unknown |
| Perfectionist prompt suppression | MEDIUM | May reduce engagement for this group |
| Stakes: Visibility-only + Encouragement | HIGH | User preference for stake types unknown |
| Recovery path design | MEDIUM | Novel design, needs user testing |
| MVP scope | HIGH | Truly minimal but testable |

# Ethical Flags

| Concern | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| Token scarcity creates anxiety | Soft cap + gain framing + automatic base | LOW — No loss possible |
| Stakes trigger shame | Limit to visibility-only + encouragement; recovery path | LOW — Shame-inducing stakes prohibited |
| Earning excludes low-motivation users | Base is automatic (zero effort) | VERY LOW — Universal earning |
| Premium creates class divide | Premium = convenience only (higher cap) | LOW — No pay-to-win |
| Perfectionist users experience anxiety | Suppress bonus prompts for HIGH Perfectionist | MEDIUM — Depends on archetype accuracy |
| Crisis bypass gamed | Behavioral signals + 30-day cooldown | MEDIUM — Some gaming possible |
| Witness relationships damaged | Witness training + delayed notifications + user control | MEDIUM — Depends on witness behavior |
