## Active Research: Behavioral Dimensions for JITAI

### RQ-001: Minimum Viable Archetype Taxonomy

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Question** | What is the minimum set of behavioral dimensions that predict differential intervention response? |
| **Status** | IN RESEARCH |
| **Blocking** | PD-001 (Archetype Philosophy) |
| **Researchers** | ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude |
| **Target** | Scientifically-grounded archetype buckets for JITAI population learning |

**Current State:**
- 6 hardcoded archetypes: PERFECTIONIST, REBEL, PROCRASTINATOR, OVERTHINKER, PLEASURE_SEEKER, PEOPLE_PLEASER
- Mix of Rubin's Four Tendencies + general behavioral patterns
- No empirical validation of bucket boundaries

**Research Approach:**
1. **Prioritization:** Parsimony + Interpretability first (cold-start math requires data density)
2. **Sources:** Peer-reviewed + preprints + JITAI lab grey literature
3. **Population:** Self-selecting productivity/identity app users (25-45, knowledge workers, prior self-improvement attempts)

**Key Sub-Questions:**
- [ ] Do current 6 archetypes map to distinct intervention responses?
- [ ] What does JITAI literature use for behavioral segmentation?
- [ ] Should we use continuous dimensions instead of discrete buckets?
- [ ] How many users per bucket needed for population learning convergence?

### RQ-002: Intervention Effectiveness Measurement

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Question** | How should "intervention response" be defined and measured? |
| **Status** | DOCUMENTED (see below) |
| **Blocking** | RQ-001 (what dimensions predict response) |

**Current Implementation (from codebase audit):**

The Pact uses a **multi-signal reward function** optimized for identity evidence, not just task completion:

```
REWARD CALCULATION (0.0 - 1.0 scale):

PRIMARY: Identity Evidence (50%)
├── Habit completed within 24h:     +0.35
├── Streak maintained:              +0.15
├── Used tiny version:              +0.25
└── No completion:                  -0.20

SECONDARY: Engagement Quality (30%)
├── Notification opened:            +0.20
├── Took action:                    +0.10
└── Dismissed without action:       -0.10

TERTIARY: Async Identity Delta (15%)
└── Identity score change (DeepSeek): +/- 0.15 (clamped)

PENALTIES:
├── Annoyance signal:               -0.40
└── Notification disabled:          -0.60 (catastrophic)
```

**Code References:**
| Metric | File | Lines |
|--------|------|-------|
| Reward calculation | `jitai_decision_engine.dart` | 772-838 |
| Outcome structure | `intervention.dart` | 479-527 |
| Bandit learning | `hierarchical_bandit.dart` | 310-330 |
| UI tracking | `intervention_modal.dart` | 40-74 |

**What We Track vs What ChatGPT Asked:**

| Measurement Type | Currently Tracked? | How |
|------------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Engagement** (tap/interact) | ✅ Yes | `notificationOpened`, `interactionType`, `timeToOpenSeconds` |
| **Behaviour Change** (habit completed) | ✅ Yes | `habitCompleted24h`, `usedTinyVersion`, `streakMaintained` |
| **Emotional Shift** | ⚠️ Partial | Emotion captured pre-intervention, no post-comparison yet |
| **Retention** | ❌ Not directly | No long-term retention tracking tied to interventions |
| **Self-Report** | ❌ Not implemented | No "was this helpful?" prompt |

**Recommended Additions:**
1. Post-intervention emotion capture (for delta)
2. Intervention-linked retention cohort analysis
3. Optional "helpful?" micro-feedback (one tap)

### RQ-003: Dimension-to-Implementation Mapping

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Question** | For each recommended behavioral dimension, what do we already track? |
| **Status** | TEMPLATE READY |
| **Action** | ChatGPT to populate after research |

**Template (to be filled by ChatGPT):**

| Dimension | In Literature? | We Track? | Interpretability | Implementation Gap |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Autonomy Need | ✅ SDT | ⚠️ Inferred from REBEL | High | No direct measure |
| Shame Sensitivity | ✅ Brené Brown | ❌ | Medium | Not tracked |
| Friction Tolerance | ✅ BJ Fogg | ⚠️ Inferred from tiny version usage | High | Indirect only |
| Reward Timing Pref | ✅ Behavioral Econ | ❌ | Medium | Not tracked |
| External Validation Need | ✅ Rubin (Obliger) | ⚠️ Inferred from witness usage | High | Indirect only |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Decision Dependencies

```
RQ-001 (Archetype Taxonomy)
    ├── Depends on: RQ-002 (How do we measure success?)
    ├── Depends on: RQ-003 (What do we already track?)
    └── Blocks: PD-001 (Archetype Philosophy decision)
                PD-102 (JITAI hardcoded vs AI)
```

## Notes for Researchers

### For ChatGPT:
When populating RQ-003 table, consider:
1. **Parsimony:** Fewer dimensions = faster population learning convergence
2. **Interpretability:** Can we explain this to users? ("You're high in autonomy need")
3. **Actionability:** Does knowing this dimension change our intervention strategy?

### For Gemini:
Focus on:
1. JITAI-specific literature (Nahum-Shani, Klasnja)
2. Mapping dimensions to intervention arm selection
3. Cold-start prior seeding strategies

### For Claude:
Focus on:
1. Codebase integration feasibility
2. Technical debt if dimensions require new tracking
3. Architecture implications of dimension changes
