# AI_HANDOVER.md — Session Continuity Protocol

> **Last Updated:** 05 January 2026
> **Purpose:** Ensure seamless context transfer between AI agent sessions
> **Owner:** Any AI agent (update at session end)

---

## What This Document Is

This is a **living document** that captures session-to-session context. Every AI agent working on this codebase MUST:
1. **Read this document** at session start
2. **Update this document** at session end

This prevents:
- Duplicate work
- Conflicting decisions made in isolation
- Lost context when sessions end or context limits are reached

## When to Start a New Session

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Context tokens | >80% capacity | Start new session with handover |
| Task pivot | Entirely new domain | Consider new session |
| Time gap | >4 hours since last activity | Re-read handover before continuing |
| Blocked by product input | Requires async human decision | Pause, document blocker, await input |
| Session crash/timeout | Unexpected termination | Next agent reads handover |

## Current Session Status

### Last Session Summary
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Session ID** | `phase-68-complete` |
| **Date** | 05 January 2026 |
| **Agent** | Gemini (Phase 68) |
| **Duration** | ~4 hours |
| **Focus** | Phase 68 Completion, Product Vision, Docs Restructure |

### What Was Accomplished
- **Completed Phase 68 (Onboarding Polish):**
  - Integrated 3 test suites (Identity, Conversational, Offline).
  - Implemented `AnalyticsService` and `RetryPolicy` (Auth/Psychometric).
  - Fixed critical `hasHolyTrinity` bug (OR -> AND).
  - Enhanced Loading State ("Neural Link" UI).
- **Product Strategy:**
  - Created `docs/PRODUCT_VISION.md` capturing strategic pivots (Anti-Identity as Shadow Clusters, Value-First Tiers).
  - Established `thepact://` branding decision.
- **Documentation:**
  - Merged `claude/docs-core-restructure-b6wmg`.
  - Cleaned up redundant `docs/PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md`.
  - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` (v6.16.0) and `ROADMAP.md` (Phase 68.5).

### What Was NOT Done (Deferred)
- **Phase 69 (Product Decisions):**
  - Invite Code implementation (blocked on specs).
  - Legacy Screen removal (blocked on deprecation approval).
  - Back Navigation Audit (deferred).
- **Technical Debt:**
  - Rename Android/iOS URL schemes (`atomichabits` -> `thepact`).
  - Device Testing (Physical).

### Blockers Awaiting Human Input
| Blocker | Question | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Invite Code Mechanics | Format, validation, tiers? | BLOCKED |
| Legacy Persistence | Deprecate `tier_selection` & `value_prop`? | BLOCKED |
| Back Navigation | Strategy for `PopScope` blocking? | DEFERRED |

## Context for Next Agent

### Key Technical Discoveries This Session

1. **Archetypes are hardcoded** (`archetype_registry.dart:175-182`):
   - Only 6 buckets: PERFECTIONIST, REBEL, PROCRASTINATOR, OVERTHINKER, PLEASURE_SEEKER, PEOPLE_PLEASER
   - Fallback is PERFECTIONIST (problematic for production)
   - Evolution service exists but assumes first classification is correct

2. **JITAI is hybrid** (not pure AI):
   - Hardcoded: Base weights, thresholds, V-O calculation
   - Adaptive: Thompson Sampling learns which interventions work
   - NOT AI: No LLM calls in decision flow

3. **Sherlock Prompt is simplistic** (`prompt_factory.dart:47-67`):
   - No turn limit
   - No extraction success criteria
   - No conversation fatigue handling
   - Needs major overhaul

4. **Holy Trinity** (`psychometric_profile.dart:17-29`):
   - Anti-Identity (Fear) — Day 1 Activation
   - Failure Archetype (History) — Day 7 Conversion
   - Resistance Lie (Excuse) — Day 30+ Retention
   - Philosophy is sound but extraction may be too simplistic

5. **LoadingInsightsScreen** is a generic spinner — should show personalized insights from permissions data + JITAI baseline

### Files You Should Read
| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `docs/CORE/PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` | All pending decisions documented |
| `docs/CORE/GLOSSARY.md` | Terminology definitions |
| `AI_CONTEXT.md` | Technical architecture (but contains stale info) |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Current priorities (needs reconciliation) |

### Files That Need Attention
| File | Issue |
|------|-------|
| `lib/features/onboarding/identity_first/sherlock_permission_screen.dart` | Loading state needs "Streaming Data" (Roadmap) |
| `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` | Rename intent filter data scheme to `thepact` |
| `ios/Runner/Info.plist` | Rename `CFBundleURLSchemes` to `thepact` |
| `docs/CORE/PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` | Single source of truth for philosophy |

## Handover Checklist for Incoming Agent

### Before Starting Work
- [ ] Read this AI_HANDOVER.md completely
- [ ] Read PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md for pending decisions
- [ ] Read GLOSSARY.md for terminology
- [ ] Check blockers — can you proceed or is human input needed?
- [ ] Identify your session's scope (docs only? code? both?)

### Before Ending Session
- [ ] Update "Last Session Summary" section above
- [ ] Update "What Was Accomplished"
- [ ] Update "What Was NOT Done (Deferred)"
- [ ] Update "Blockers Awaiting Human Input" if new blockers found
- [ ] Update "Context for Next Agent" with discoveries
- [ ] Commit this file with descriptive message
- [ ] Push to branch

## Notes for Human (Oliver)

This handover protocol was created because:
1. Gemini made product decisions without explicit approval
2. Context is lost between sessions
3. Multiple agents working on the same codebase need coordination

**Your Action Items:**
- Review PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md and resolve PENDING items
- Confirm core docs structure is acceptable
- Decide on archetype philosophy (future sprint)
- Decide on Sherlock prompt direction (future sprint)
