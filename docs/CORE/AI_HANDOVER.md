# AI_HANDOVER.md — Session Continuity Protocol

> **Last Updated:** 05 January 2026
> **Purpose:** Ensure seamless context transfer between AI agent sessions
> **Owner:** Any AI agent (update at session end)

---

## What This Document Is

This is a **living document** that captures session-to-session context. Every AI agent working on this codebase MUST:
1. **Read this document** at session start
2. **Update this document** at session end

This prevents:
- Duplicate work
- Conflicting decisions made in isolation
- Lost context when sessions end or context limits are reached

---

## When to Start a New Session

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Context tokens | >80% capacity | Start new session with handover |
| Task pivot | Entirely new domain | Consider new session |
| Time gap | >4 hours since last activity | Re-read handover before continuing |
| Blocked by product input | Requires async human decision | Pause, document blocker, await input |
| Session crash/timeout | Unexpected termination | Next agent reads handover |

## Current Session Status

### Last Session Summary
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Session ID** | `ai-coordination-setup` |
| **Date** | 05 January 2026 |
| **Agent** | Claude (Opus) |
| **Duration** | ~30 mins |
| **Focus** | Documentation Enhancement, AI Coordination Setup |

### What Was Accomplished
- **Documentation Improvements:**
  - Created symlink `AI_HANDOVER.md` → `docs/CORE/AI_HANDOVER.md` at project root for easier access
  - Expanded ALL Tier 1 Pending Decisions with detailed codebase context:
    - PD-001 (Archetype Philosophy): Added 6 archetype table, code refs, fallback issue
    - PD-002 (Streaks vs Rolling): Documented philosophical tension between code and messaging
    - PD-003 (Holy Trinity): Added extraction gate logic, field definitions
    - PD-004 (Dev Mode): Documented naming confusion (`developerMode` vs `isPremium`)
  - Expanded ALL Tier 2 Pending Decisions with codebase context:
    - PD-101 (Sherlock Prompt): Found TWO conflicting prompts, documented cheat code issue
    - PD-102 (JITAI): Documented full pipeline, hardcoded vs adaptive components
    - PD-103 (Sensitivity): Confirmed NOT IMPLEMENTED
    - PD-104 (Loading Insights): Corrected status — IS implemented, decision is about content

### What Was NOT Done (Deferred)
- **Phase 69 (Product Decisions):**
  - Invite Code implementation (blocked on specs).
  - Legacy Screen removal (blocked on deprecation approval).
  - Back Navigation Audit (deferred).
- **Technical Debt:**
  - Rename Android/iOS URL schemes (`atomichabits` -> `thepact`).
  - Device Testing (Physical).

### Blockers Awaiting Human Input
| Blocker | Question | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Archetype Philosophy (PD-001) | Hardcoded vs Dynamic vs Hybrid? | BLOCKED |
| Streaks vs Consistency (PD-002) | Use `gracefulScore` or `currentStreak`? | BLOCKED |
| Holy Trinity Validity (PD-003) | Is 3-trait model sufficient? | BLOCKED |
| Dev Mode Purpose (PD-004) | Rename `developerMode` → `isPremium`? | BLOCKED |
| Sherlock Prompt (PD-101) | Which of 2 prompts is canonical? | BLOCKED |
| Invite Code Mechanics | Format, validation, tiers? | BLOCKED |
| Legacy Persistence | Deprecate `tier_selection` & `value_prop`? | BLOCKED |

## Context for Next Agent

### Key Technical Discoveries This Session

1. **Archetypes are hardcoded** (`archetype_registry.dart:175-182`):
   - Only 6 buckets: PERFECTIONIST, REBEL, PROCRASTINATOR, OVERTHINKER, PLEASURE_SEEKER, PEOPLE_PLEASER
   - Fallback is PERFECTIONIST (problematic for production)
   - Evolution service exists but assumes first classification is correct

2. **JITAI is hybrid** (not pure AI):
   - Hardcoded: Base weights, thresholds, V-O calculation
   - Adaptive: Thompson Sampling learns which interventions work
   - NOT AI: No LLM calls in decision flow

3. **TWO Sherlock Prompts exist** (CONFLICTING):
   - `ai_prompts.dart:717-745` — Calls AI "Puck", uses tool calling
   - `prompt_factory.dart:47-67` — Calls AI "Sherlock", has cheat code
   - No turn limit in either
   - No extraction success criteria
   - Needs consolidation before overhaul

4. **Holy Trinity** (`psychometric_profile.dart:17-29`):
   - Anti-Identity (Fear) — Day 1 Activation
   - Failure Archetype (History) — Day 7 Conversion
   - Resistance Lie (Excuse) — Day 30+ Retention
   - Philosophy is sound but extraction may be too simplistic

5. **LoadingInsightsScreen** is ALREADY implemented with animated insight cards — decision is about WHAT insights to show, not whether to implement

### Files You Should Read
| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `docs/CORE/PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` | All pending decisions documented |
| `docs/CORE/GLOSSARY.md` | Terminology definitions |
| `AI_CONTEXT.md` | Technical architecture (but contains stale info) |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Current priorities (needs reconciliation) |

### Files That Need Attention
| File | Issue |
|------|-------|
| `lib/features/onboarding/identity_first/sherlock_permission_screen.dart` | Loading state needs "Streaming Data" (Roadmap) |
| `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` | Rename intent filter data scheme to `thepact` |
| `ios/Runner/Info.plist` | Rename `CFBundleURLSchemes` to `thepact` |
| `docs/CORE/PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` | Single source of truth for philosophy |

## Handover Checklist for Incoming Agent

### Before Starting Work
- [ ] Read this AI_HANDOVER.md completely
- [ ] Read PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md for pending decisions
- [ ] Read GLOSSARY.md for terminology
- [ ] Check blockers — can you proceed or is human input needed?
- [ ] Identify your session's scope (docs only? code? both?)

### Before Ending Session
- [ ] Update "Last Session Summary" section above
- [ ] Update "What Was Accomplished"
- [ ] Update "What Was NOT Done (Deferred)"
- [ ] Update "Blockers Awaiting Human Input" if new blockers found
- [ ] Update "Context for Next Agent" with discoveries
- [ ] Commit this file with descriptive message
- [ ] Push to branch

## Notes for Human (Oliver)

This handover protocol was created because:
1. Gemini made product decisions without explicit approval
2. Context is lost between sessions
3. Multiple agents working on the same codebase need coordination

**Your Action Items:**
- Review PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md and resolve PENDING items
- Confirm core docs structure is acceptable
- Decide on archetype philosophy (future sprint)
- Decide on Sherlock prompt direction (future sprint)
