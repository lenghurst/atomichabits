## 🧠 The "Brain Surgery" Protocol (Phase 33)

We have just completed a critical architectural overhaul ("Brain Surgery 2.5") to close the loop on social accountability.

### Key Changes
1.  **The Pledge (Contract Card):** Before paying, users now see a binding contract card listing their specific habit, witness, and stakes.
2.  **Witness Invite (Share Sheet):** Selecting a witness now triggers a native share sheet (WhatsApp, SMS, etc.) to actually invite them.
3.  **Explicit Auth:** Google Sign-In now explicitly requests `email` and `profile` scopes for trust.
4.  **Voice Coach Polish:** Added sound effects and improved feedback for the AI Coach placeholder.

## 🎯 The Core Philosophy

Traditional habit apps fail because they rely on **you**.  
**The Pact** relies on **us**.

1. **The Contract:** You don't just "set a goal." You sign a **Pact** with a friend (Witness).
2. **The Wax Seal:** A haptic-heavy, ceremonial UI that makes commitment feel weighty.
3. **The Witness:** Your friend gets notified when you succeed (or fail).
4. **Graceful Consistency:** We measure rolling consistency, not fragile streaks.
5. **Voice First:** Talk to your AI coach like a friend, not a form.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture: "The Unified Front"

We use a **Hybrid Viral Architecture** to ensure invite links work everywhere.

1. **The Signal (Mobile App):**
   - Generates a link: `https://thepact.co/join/XYZ`

2. **The Anchor (React Web):**
   - Hosted on Netlify.
   - Detects OS (Android/iOS/Desktop).
   - **Mobile:** Redirects to App Store / Play Store with `referrer` params.
   - **Desktop:** Shows a high-fidelity landing page to capture emails.

3. **The Receiver (Mobile App):**
   - Uses `PlayInstallReferrer` API on Android to auto-accept invites after install.
   - Bypasses onboarding for invited users ("The Red Carpet").

### Voice Architecture (NEW)

```
User → Voice Onboarding Screen
         ↓
     Gemini Live Service
         ↓
     [Auth Check]
         ↓
   ┌─────┴─────┐
   │           │
Supabase    DEV MODE
Edge Fn     (Direct API)
   │           │
   └─────┬─────┘
         ↓
   Ephemeral Token
         ↓
   Gemini Live API
   (WebSocket)
         ↓
   Real-time Voice
```

**Production:** Uses Supabase Edge Function to get ephemeral tokens (requires auth)  
**Dev Mode:** Uses Gemini API key directly (debug builds only, no auth required)

## 🚀 Next Steps: Final Build & Smoke Test

**Phase 33 has implemented the "Brain Surgery 2.5" recommendations. The final step before launch is a full smoke test.**

### 1. Get New Dependencies

Run `flutter pub get` to install the new contact picker dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Rebuild the Mobile App (APK)

The Flutter app must be rebuilt to include all the new onboarding flows.

```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define-from-file=secrets.json
```

### 3. Perform the Final Smoke Test

1. **Test The Pledge:** Verify the "Contract Card" appears on the Tier Selector screen.
2. **Test Witness Invite:** Verify the Share Sheet opens when selecting a witness.
3. **Test Voice Feedback:** Verify the sound effect plays when tapping the AI Coach sample.
4. **Test Google Auth:** Verify the permission dialog requests email/profile access.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Mobile App (Flutter)

```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run with secrets (required for AI features)
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=secrets.json

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release --dart-define-from-file=secrets.json
```

### Secrets Configuration

Create `secrets.json` in project root:

```json
{
  "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY": "your_deepseek_key",
  "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your_gemini_key",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_key"
}
```

**Note:** Ensure `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is named exactly as shown.

## 🎨 Customization & Branding

### App Icon

The app icon is **The Pact handshake logo** (blue-to-pink gradient).

**Location:** `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher.png`

To update:
1. Replace icon files in all `mipmap-*` directories
2. Or use `flutter_launcher_icons` package (see docs)

### Branding

- **App Name:** "The Pact"
- **Package:** `co.thepact.app`
- **Domain:** `thepact.co`
- **Colors:** Blue (#00B4D8) to Pink (#FF006E) gradient

## 🚢 Deployment

### Mobile (Flutter)

```bash
# Android
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define-from-file=secrets.json

# iOS
flutter build ipa --release --dart-define-from-file=secrets.json
```

### Web (React)

Auto-deployed via Netlify on push to `main` branch.

**Manual deploy:**
```bash
cd landing_page
npm run build
# Upload dist/ to Netlify
```

### Supabase Edge Functions

```bash
# Deploy get-gemini-ephemeral-token function
supabase functions deploy get-gemini-ephemeral-token --project-ref lwzvvaqgvcmsxblcglxo

# Set secrets
supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key --project-ref lwzvvaqgvcmsxblcglxo
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Voice Interface Not Connecting

1. **Check Dev Mode:** Settings → Developer Settings → Premium (Tier 2) enabled?
2. **Check API Key:** Is `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `secrets.json`?
3. **Check Logs:** Run `flutter run` and watch console for errors
4. **Copy Debug Info:** Triple-tap screen title → Copy Debug Info → Share with team

### Google Sign-In Failing

See **[docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md](./docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md)** for full setup guide.

**Quick check:**
- SHA-1 fingerprint matches? Run `cd android && ./gradlew signingReport`
- Google OAuth client configured in Supabase?
- Package name is `co.thepact.app`?
