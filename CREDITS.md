## 🎨 Design Inspiration

### Frameworks
- **James Clear** — Atomic Habits (Identity-based habits, 2-minute rule)
- **Nir Eyal** — Hooked (Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment)
- **B.J. Fogg** — Tiny Habits (B = MAP, Ability > Motivation)

### Philosophy
- **"Never Miss Twice"** — Missing once is an accident; missing twice is a new habit
- **"Graceful Consistency"** — Progress > Perfection
- **"Identity First"** — You don't build habits; you become someone who has them
